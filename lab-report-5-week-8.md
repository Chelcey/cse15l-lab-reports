## Here is `grade.sh` in a code block
> <span style="color:blue"> Details about the code block.</span>
```

```

## Student Submission 1

> <span style="color:blue"> **Grade:** pending</span>

## Student Submission 2

> <span style="color:blue"> **Grade:** pending</span>

## Student Submission 2 
![Student Submission 3](ss3.jpg)
> <span style="color:blue"> **Grade:** pending</span>

## Describing a trace of what your `grade.sh` 
### <span style="color:red"> Student Submission Pending</span>
- [ ] For each line with a command, what is its *standard output* and *standard error* are for this run, and whether its *return code* was zero or nonzero.

> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>

- [ ] For each line with an `if` statement, whether the condition was true or false, and why

> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>


- [ ] Indicate each line that *does not* run (maybe because it is an `if` branch that doesn't evaluate, or after an early exit)

> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>
 
> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> Pending...</span>

## Why do we need to use Big O for?
> <span style="color:blue"> used to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements</span>

## Why do we need to classify algorithms according to run time or space requirements?
> <span style="color:blue"> Knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming</span>
> <span style="color:blue"> Can make the program behave in required optimal conditions</span>

## What does optimal conditions means? 
> <span style="color:blue"> best level or state that it could achieve</span>
