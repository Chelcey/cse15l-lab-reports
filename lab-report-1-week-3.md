### <span style="color:crimson red"> *Explain the connection between the symptom and the bug:* </span>
### <span style="color:purple"> I think the connection between the symptom and the bug is that the symptom is what goes on in the output terminal, whereas the bug is the issue (problem) </span>

### <span style="color:crimson red"> *Why does the bug cause that particular symptom for that particular input?* </span>
### <span style="color:purple"> The bug causes that particular symptom for that particular input because it is the flaw in the program. Since its a flaw, it affects the output in the terminal which is the symptom. </span>
