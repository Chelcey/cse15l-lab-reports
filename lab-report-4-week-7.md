# <span style="color:fuschia"> **Lab Goals:**</span>
> Focuses on VIM (material from Week 6 Lab).

# <span style="color:maroon"> **Pre-Task List:**</span>
- [x] Fork the given [Repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-grader)
- [x] Given a list of repositories to test the grader

# <span style="color:maroon"> **Part 1:Task List:**</span>

- [x] Pick one of the tasks from the week 6 lab that your group completed in Vim in the second set of tasks.
   ### <span style="color:brown">Changing the name of the `start` parameter and its uses to `bases`</span>
   ### <span style="color:blue">I would have to say that I donâ€™t think my VIM commands are accurate. I accidentally forgot to keep complete track of how many `j`s ,`l`s , <esc>'s, and `:wq`s I have done.  I would say that this is just a rough estimate and that there is altogether at least 30 key presses at the most. </span>
      
- [x]  give the shortest sequence of vim commands (less than 30 total keys pressed)
       1. Write out the sequence of keys to press using code formatting (with backticks `). 
       2. Use `<>` to indicate special keys (`<Backspace>` or `<Enter>` or `<Esc>`) and just the keys themselves for other keys pressed. 
       3. Take a screenshot and describe which commands/keypresses got to that step, for each command where you move the cursor or change the text. 
    ### <span style="color:blue"> 
- [ ]  Write out every key pressed, including if you use the arrows or `h``j``k``l` to move around. 
- [ ] description/screenshot of typing `/apple<Enter>` and the cursor jumpting to the start of `apple`
- [ ] description/screenshot of typing `ce`, switching into input mode and deleting the word `apple`
- [ ] description/screenshot of typing `banana<Esc>`, replacing the text and returning to insert mode
- [ ] description/screenshot of typing `:w<Enter`, saving the changes
      
# <span style="color:maroon"> **Part 2:Task List:**</span>
- [ ] Start in Visual Studio Code and make the edit there (**what edit??**)
- [ ] `scp` the file to the remote server and run it there to confirm it works (you can just run `bash test.sh` on the remote to test it out)
- [ ] Start already logged into a `ssh` session
- [ ] Make the edit for the task you chose (**I didn't chose this**)  in Vim, exit Vim and run `bash test.sh`
- [ ] Report how long it took you to make the edit in seconds in both styles, and any difficulties or details that came up in doing so. 
      

## Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
> <span style="color:blue"> I would prefer to use the easier one, but in my case I choose neither. I currently don't want to even think about working on a program that I can run remotely. I used to want to work remotely, but now at this point, I don't have what it takes. It gives me stress and anxiety. At this point, I am about to quit.</span>

## What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!?) 
> <span style="color:blue"> The projects or tasks that factored in my decision is realizing that I wasted my whole life doing something that I am not even great at, believing that I can do it. This is a major factor into my current decision of my view point.  </span>
